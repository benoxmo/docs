description: How to get Cred from your contributions.
---

As soon as you interact with Sourcecred, you will be part of the Contribution Graph (i.e. a network of connected contributions) in which some [Cred] will flow or be minted in your direction. 


Your contributions is tracked across the three active plugins we have for now. The types of contributions & plugins are likely to increase. But for now, small is beautiful.

### 💧 Cred Minting
the community decides to Mint some Cred for you, e.g. because they found something valuable. This Cred just magically appears out of nowhere in your direction. Say differently, you are now able to collect some drops of water from the sky



### 🏄🏾Cred flowing
Being part of the community, you share the same Contribution Graph. Your contribution is interconnected with others in all its different ways and across the time. Someone has responsed to your post. This same person has liked some other posts. Or later, another person will acknowledge your contribution. Cred will be flowing in/out on you but at a different speed. 

Say differently, you are part of an environment that sustains itself across the time. This means you collect drops of water that will flow to someone's else direction downstream. Or some newcomers upperstream will provide you some fresh drops. But any point the sky&sun will make sure that some of your drops evaporate to keep everything in balance
