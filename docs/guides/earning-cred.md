description: How to get Cred from your contributions.
---

As soon as you interact with SourceCred, you will be part of the Contribution Graph (i.e. a network of connected contributions). Being part of this Graph is like having your own pond now that holds [Cred]. Cred will flow in&out in different ways, just like water in a pond. 



### üíß Cred Minting
The community decides to Mint some Cred for you, e.g. because they found something valuable. This Cred just magically appears out of nowhere in your direction. If we compare Cred to water, minting Cred would be like rain - it would fall from the sky, new water collected in your pond !

The types of contributions & plugins are likely to increase. But for now, small is beautiful. Your contributions are tracked across the three active plugins in the following ways:


| üí¨ [Discord] | üßµ [Discourse] | ü¶† [Github]| ü•á [Initiatives]
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
|someone gives your post : <img width="20" alt="SourceCred" src='https://sourcecred.io/img/favicon.png' /> or :100: or :+1:| someone gives your post/reply a :heart: | You open a pull request  | you make a specific task approved by the community




### üèÑüèæCred flowing
All the contributions you and your community make are on the same Contribution Graph. Each of your contributions is interconnected with other community contributions, across different platforms. Contributions are even also connected through time - today's contributions connect to contributions from yesterday, last week, etc

To put it differently, you are part of an environment that sustains itself across time for which water is key. In your pond, water will not only flow from the sky. Indeed, being connected with other ponds will make the exchange of water possible. It might be drops or a steady stream depending on the size of your connections. And at any point the sky&sun will make sure that some of your drops evaporate to keep everything in balance


### üí° At a conceptual level 

When you react to a message with <img width="20" alt="SourceCred" src='https://sourcecred.io/img/favicon.png' /> in one of the plugins :

  - it creates a new reaction node in the graph, which mints Cred 
  - it creates an edge from the person reacting (you), to the reaction node
  - it creates an edge pointing from the reaction node to the message receiving the reaction
  
Minting new cred is also a change for the entire Contribution Graph. It will therefore induce a change on how Cred flows for the others so as to keep everything in balance. Again, we need to make sure that water is circulating well with no congestions.
